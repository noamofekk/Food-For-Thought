# Food-For-Thought
Just an idea i had and thought, why not? without knowing anything.


an App with alot of "advanced settings" for maximum potential of costumiazable user interface that is personalized for you, by you.
pretty much taking all the best things about all the best apps and trying to make a "SUPER-PLATFORM"

I just had the idea, but I got no clue if it's even possible, if not, it's a great book.
I just know that anythings thats ever been done on any webpage,app or others, every design or idea, someone is responsible for it and I think there should be a place to hear all those experianced people working on different platforms in different adresses to discuss a great way to maximaize everything.
I know theres a lot more than that, which I don't know. 
I don't know anything. im just a person who likes to use lots of apps.
so I'm writing this hopefully that someone who's bored of being quarintined and looks for a fun project on the side will somehow read this and maybe wanna be a part of it? or at least explain to me why this isn't gonna work? cause all I hear from people that its not possible but noone really explained to me why.
anyway, try reading this in the eyes of a 24year old vet student whose bored at home.
